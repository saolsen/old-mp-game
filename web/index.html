    Welcome to the game. It is a very fun game.
    <p>
      This is a pre alpha so expect breaking changes (hopefully) every day.
      For now when there is a new version you must download a new client, hopefully we will have a way to auto update the client before a real alpha program starts.
    </p>
    The latest game version is {{.Include "/version.txt"}}

      There's finna be some download links here.
