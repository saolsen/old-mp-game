    <p>
      Welcome to the game. This is a pre alpha so breaking changes will come (hopefully) every day. When there's an update you must download the latest client. Hopefully by the time we get to an alpha the client will auto update.
    </p> 
    The latest game version is <code>{{.Include "/version.txt"}}</code>
    <p>
      <a href="/builds/game-osx-{{.Include "/version.txt"}}.zip">OSX Client</a>
      <a href="/builds/game-linux-{{.Include "/version.txt"}}.tar.gz">Linux Client</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: The linux client currently requires you to install sdl2 and sdl2-net.<br>
      In ubuntu that would be <code>sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev</code>
    </p>
